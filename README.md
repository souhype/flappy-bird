# Flappy Bird Clone

This is a simple clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, made with HTML5 canvas and vanilla JavaScript. The goal of the game is to control a bird and avoid hitting the pipes that appear on the screen. The game is over when the bird hits a pipe or the ground. The score is increased by one every time the bird passes a pair of pipes. The game is responsive and supports both keyboard and touch input.

## How to play

To start the game, press the spacebar key. To make the bird jump, press the spacebar key or tap on the screen. The bird will fall down due to gravity, so you need to time your jumps carefully. Try to pass as many pipes as possible without crashing.
