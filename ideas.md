I'm glad it works. There are many possible features that could make the game more fun, depending on your creativity and preference. Here are some examples:

- You could add some sound effects and music to create a more immersive and engaging experience. For example, you could play a flapping sound when the player jumps, a hitting sound when the player collides with an obstacle, and a background music that matches the mood of the game.
- You could add some animations and effects to make the game more visually appealing. For example, you could make the player sprite flap its wings, rotate when it falls, and explode when it hits an obstacle. You could also add some particles or trails to the player and the obstacles, and some transitions or fades to the game over screen.
- You could add some variations to the obstacles and the background to make the game more diverse and challenging. For example, you could change the color, shape, size, or speed of the obstacles, or make them move up and down or rotate. You could also change the background image or color, or add some scrolling parallax layers to create a sense of depth.
- You could add some power-ups or bonuses to make the game more rewarding and strategic. For example, you could add some coins or stars that the player can collect to increase their score or unlock new features. You could also add some items that can help or hinder the player, such as a shield that protects them from one obstacle, a magnet that attracts coins, or a bomb that explodes nearby obstacles.
- You could add some levels or modes to make the game more progressive and replayable. For example, you could create different stages with different themes, difficulties, or objectives. You could also add some options for the player to choose their difficulty level, their player sprite, or their game mode (such as endless mode, time trial mode, or challenge mode).
